# z-Carousal
A simple, high-performance and cross-browser jQuery text rotator and carousal plugin for Vue.js. The plugin supports usage of Animate.css animations.

### Prerequisites

z-Carousal is a jQuery based plugin. So, please make sure that jQuery is installed and has been initialized before z-Carousal is initialized.

Install jQuery via npm:

```
npm install --save-dev jquery
```

z-Carousal by default uses jQuery's ```fadeIn``` animation. z-Carousal also supports animations provided by [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css). Animate.css has to be installed for using custom animations and this is not mandatory.

Install Animate.css via npm:

```
npm install --save-dev animate.css
```

z-Carousal also supports carousal pagination which uses a [FontAwesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) icon by default. Install FontAwesome to use the default pagination style. If pagination is not required or if you want to custom style the pagination icons, then FontAwesome is not required.

Install FontAwesome via npm:

```
npm install --save-dev font-awesome
```

## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev z-carousal
